Sipas - Simple Pastebin Service
-------------------------------

This projects goal is to be a simple pastebin that depends just on basic LAMP
stack so it is easy to deploy.

Giving it a try
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It requires PHP (tested on 7.X) and it is written using Nette framework and
GeSHi for syntax highlighting. All dependencies (except from a database
bindings of your choice) are wriitten in `composer.json` so you can install
those simple by calling `composer update` in your checkout directory.

What you need apart from dependencies is some database. You should configure
one in `app/config/local.neon` file. For example like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
database:
        dsn: 'sqlite:%appDir%/../datat/pastes.sqlite3'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To fill database, use files from `doc/sql/schema` directory in the alphabetical
sequence. If you need some sample data, you can use files from `doc/sql/data`.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the default identity to get some basic "branding" by adding the
following lines into `app/config/local.neon` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
constants:
    TITLE: 'My Super Cool Pastebin'
